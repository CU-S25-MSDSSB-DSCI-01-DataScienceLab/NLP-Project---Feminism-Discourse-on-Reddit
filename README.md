# Natural Language Processing of Feminist Discourse on Reddit: Patterns, Sentiment, and Polarization

**Objective**: This report uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the dynamics of feminist discourse in key Reddit communities. The goal is to map polarization and identify recurring themes.

**Methods**: 
We collected and analyzed thousands of posts and comments from pro-feminist (e.g., r/Feminism, r/TwoXChromosomes) and anti-feminist (e.g., r/MensRights) subreddits. Using automated sentiment analysis and topic modeling, we identified emotional tone (positive/negative/neutral) and key themes on both sides of the feminist ideological spectrum.

**Implications & Value**:
This study highlights how automated text analysis can paint a comprehensive picture of social online debates and inform educators, community moderators, and researchers about the nature and intensity of ideological divisions on social media.
